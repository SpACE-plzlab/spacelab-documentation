This repository is meant to be a central documentation repository for all lab members and some collaborators.   

Any information that is relevant across all projects, or for simply doing Spatial Ecology at scale on your computer, the [MSU High Performance Computing Center](http://wiki.hpcc.msu.edu) or in the 'cloud' should go here.   

Narrative documentation is meant to go in this Github projects [wiki](https://github.com/SpACE-plzlab/spacelab-documentation/wiki).  See Github's [Wiki Docs](https://help.github.com/en/github/building-a-strong-community/adding-or-editing-wiki-pages) for how to use this wiki, but please don't hesitate to put any useful information by creating a new page without worrying about formatting or structure.  Even if it's just a sentence or two.  Information like this can be restructured later (so-called wiki gardening).   If you create a page if would be helpful if you add a short introduction or preamble to give the reader context.     

The code repository for this project is for code snippets, examples, Jupyter notebooks, Rstudio notebooks, code suggestions and ideas.  The goal is to have a repository of miscellaneous code that other lab members can clone and use as a basis for their work.    For now, put anything you think may useful to the lab in this repository by cloning the master branch, creating a folder, adding a file README.md in that folder and pushing back to the master branch.  

if you are new to git but have code to share, you can put code in any of the wiki pages.  if you paste code into a wiki page, if you put three 'back ticks'  ( <pre>```</pre> ) before and after the code block then it will look like code, and punctuation won't be interpreted as wiki formatting.
